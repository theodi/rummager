## Health check

As we work on rummager we want some objective metrics of the performance of search. That's what the health check is for.

To run it first download the healthcheck data:

$ ./bin/health_check -d

Then run against your chosen indices:

$ ./bin/health_check

Against remote:

$ ./bin/health_check -j "https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json"

Against development:

$ ./bin/health_check -j "http://www.dev.gov.uk/api/search.json"
