# Elasticsearch tries to find spelling suggestions for words that don't occur
# in our content, as they are probably mispelled. However, currently it is
# returning suggestions for words that do not occur in *every* index. Because
# the `service-manual` index contains very few words, elasticsearch returns
# too many spelling suggestions for common terms. For example, using the
# suggester on all four indices will yield a suggestion for "PAYE", because
# it's mentioned only in the `government` index, and not the `service-manual`
# index.
#
# This issue is mentioned in
# https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/7472.
#
# Our solution is to run a separate query to fetch the suggestions, only using
# the indices we want.
